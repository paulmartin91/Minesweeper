<h1>Minesweeper</h1>
<p>The classic game Minesweeper for all the mac users out there who miss the old windows 95 days!
<br>
<sub><i>Coded from scratch by Paul Martin using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and a bit of JQuery too.</i></sub>
</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Set your size!</b> - Type in a number and generate a minefield, just remember there is no limit to this, so don't go crazy and crash your browser!</li>
<li><b>Number Guides</b> - Just like the classic game, clicking on a safe square adjacent to a mine will give you the number of adjacent mines</li>
<li><b>Empty Squares</b> - Squares with no mines adjacent will case a chain reaction of empty squares, this is particularly satisfying on the 100x100 grid!</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>So please enjoy and let me know what you think, or if you come across any bugs!</p>
